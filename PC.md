| **1. Potential Cures**: Gene therapy is a revolutionary method that can prevent and get rid of diseases in the human body. Through this technology, conditions that are deemed as incurable can be cured ex. very bad cancer.   |  **1. Risk of Cancer:** A crucial challenge in gene therapy revolves across the potential risk of causing more or bringing in cancerous cells. This is one of the big issues in this treatment. Although it has been developed to minimize the chances, it is always possible that it may happen to someone. |
| **2. One-Time Treatment:** If the gene therapy is successful, it could possibly be a one time treatment rather than having to take multiple doses which can cause harm to you. This would mean that the cells would be stable and healthy while also getting rid of diseases. | **2. Immune System Response:** The body’s immune system may not respond well to the added genetic material, which would cause the treatment to be unsuccessful. Even if it is successful, the immune system may cause it to not be very efficient.|
| **3. Hereditary Disease Prevention:** By eliminating the genes that cause these diseases and disorders and replacing/fixing them, gene therapy can be a way to ensure that the issues one has doesn’t pass down to other generations. | **3. Ethical Concerns:** There are many ethical and moral concerns about gene editing, particularly about designer babies. As gene editing the embryo can ensure the baby is healthy, it also can be abused and is not fair to others. |
| **4. Precision Medicine:** Gene therapy is a very unique treatment because it is tailored to the genetic profile of the patient.  Through this personalized treatment, it is ensured that the effectiveness is better while minimizing the chances of the immune system rejecting the cells. | **4. Financial Costs:** Although this is a great solution to preventing many diseases, it can be extremely costly.  This would be completely out of budget for many people who need it. An AJMC article stated that as of July 2023, “8 oncologic gene therapies have been approved by the FDA, ranging in price from $65,000 to $475,000, and 8 non oncological gene therapies have been approved, with prices ranging from $630,000 to $3.5 million.” |
| | **5. Long-Term Effects Uncertainty:** As gene therapy is a new type of technology and is still developing, there could be long term harmful effect on the patient. This could make their situation worse or cause lifetime issues that can’t be fixed. |
