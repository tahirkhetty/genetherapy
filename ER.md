Gene therapy has enhanced scientists’ understanding of cells and cellular processes because they now have further understanding of cellular mutations.

Cellular mutation is when there is any abnormal change in the DNA sequence of a cell. For scientists’ to proceed with gene therapy, they would have to know how cellular mutations occur from possibly an error during cell division and how it can affect the way our cells produce protein.

Gene therapy helped to understand how genetic diseases can be inherited and how to fix it from the egg and sperm cell before it becomes an embryo. It also helped our understanding of stem cells and how they can be altered or injected into someone to fix the targeted problem.
