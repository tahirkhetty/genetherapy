- Although gene therapy may seem like a great treatment for many harmful diseases like cancer, diabetes, AIDS and heart disease, there are many negative effects of gene therapy on the human body.

- As gene therapy is relatively new, with its first trial dating back about 30 years ago, gene therapy has serious health risks such as toxicity,  inflammation and especially cancer.

- Though lately, the techniques used in gene therapy have developed, lessening the risk of cancer and damage to the immune system.

- Gene therapy is not fool proof and can lead up to more rounds of going through gene therapy, each potentially causing more negative impacts on the body. 

- The main issue is that the immune system is designed in a way that anytime a foreign thing enters the human body, it attacks it.

- Also, when having more than one trial, the immune system would have already been introduced to the ‘invading gene,’ and know them as a threat, making it harder for the treatment to be successful.

- The risks of gene therapy on the body could be very devastating and may make situations worse than they already are.

- Of course, many of these treatments do help and gene therapy has had successful trials, but there is never a guarantee.
