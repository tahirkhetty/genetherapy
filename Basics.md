### Gene Therapy Remarks
> A groundbreaking gene therapy has been hailed as a 'medical  magic wand' after the treatment transformed the lives of patients with a hereditary disorder that causes painful and potentially fatal swelling"
> 
> – _The Guardian_

> "We used to think that our fate was in our stars, but now we know that, in large measure, our fate is in our genes..."
>
> quotes James Watson. This fate that Watson is talking about is contained in our genes, and deals with a new technique, gene therapy (North Dakota State University).

>"Genome editing is a powerful, scientific technology that can reshape medical treatments and people's lives, but it can also harmfully reduce human diversity  and increase social inequality"
>
> – _Scientific American_

>"Gene therapy is a cornerstone of our vision for the future; it creates almost unlimited possibilities  to deliver new transformative medicines,"
>
>states Sylke Poehline, Senior Vice President of Global Head Therapeutic Modalities at Roche.


## Gene Therapy: How it Works
The idea of gene therapy is to treat or prevent diseases that are caused by a genetic defect or a gene mutation. Gene therapy works by adding or replacing a broken gene in order to cure a disease or help fight the disease. There are two types of gene therapy, somatic and germline. Somatic gene therapy corrects defective DNA and uses RNA molecules to cure or treat a disease that's either inherited or a mutation. Germline gene therapy corrects a defective egg or sperm cell that could be inherited in future offspring. 

## Undergoing Gene Therapy
When undergoing gene therapy there is required preparation before the procedure. First the doctor must find and identify the defective gene and locate the faulty cells in the organs or tissues. At that point a working version of the gene must be available and will then deliver the gene to the cell. Each procedure depends on the type of gene therapy being used. Doctors may remove bone marrow from the hip bone or draw blood and use either to be exposed to the virus or vector that has the desired genetic material. When the vector has entered the cell it will then be injected back into the tissue or vein along the altered genes. Other vectors that are currently being researched are stem cells and liposomes. 

## The Purpose of Gene Therapy
Gene therapy is currently still an evolving field of research but is being used because it shows great promise in the future. There have already been several successful clinical trials in curing various diseases in people such as severe combined immune deficiency, hemophilia, blindness caused by retinitis pigmentosa and leukemia. Gene therapy could also allow patients to live without the need of ongoing treatments and the burden of daily disease management. Gene therapy not only has long lasting effects curing the patient for life but it can also have a positive effect through generations. This means that future offspring won’t inherit the faulty gene from a parent which would inevitably result in a world with less genetic diseases.

## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
