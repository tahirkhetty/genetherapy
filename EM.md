Gene therapy has enhanced scientists’ understanding of cells and cellular processes because they now have further understanding of cellular mutations.

Cellular mutation is when there is any abnormal change in the DNA sequence of a cell. For scientists’ to proceed with gene therapy, they would have to know how cellular mutations occur from possibly an error during cell division and how it can affect the way our cells produce protein.

Gene therapy helped to understand how genetic diseases can be inherited and how to fix it from the egg and sperm cell before it becomes an embryo. It also helped our understanding of stem cells and how they can be altered or injected into someone to fix the targeted problem.

- Gene therapy has no negative nor positive significant effect on the quality of an environment. Though, the potential for gene therapy is endless. As gene therapy is a currently developing treatment on humans, there isn’t much it can do for the environment... For now.

- As the health/future of forests and their ecosystems are facing many threats, biotech trees could potentially be the cure to these issues.

- A report in 2012 by the US Forest Service declared that about 7% of US forests were in danger to lose at least one fourth of their tree vegetation by the next 15 years.

- Although this may seem like a small percentage, this may only be the start of a large decline in forest trees and its vegetation.

- This estimate was 40% higher than the previous estimate that was made 6 years before the 2012 report.

- Also, as climate change continues to increase worldwide, the application of gene therapy to not just trees, but also plants and other parts of the environment that need sustainable solutions.

- Gene therapy has the potential to lessen the impact and maybe even start reducing the rate of climate change.

- Though, in the future, we can expect great things from this technology. An example of this is through the idea of biotech trees where genetically engineered trees are entered and grown in forests.
