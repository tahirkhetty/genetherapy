As gene therapy can be a leading treatment in saving one’s life, it can also be easily abused and seen as morally/ethically wrong. In fact the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health set aside around 5% of the annual Human Genome Projects budget in order to study the ethical, legal, and social issues that arose from gene therapy. Some of these concerns are about:


1. Distinguishing whether or not the use of gene therapy is either ‘good’ or ‘bad.’

2. Deciding which traits are normal and which should be considered as a disability or disorder.​

3. The high cost factor - will gene therapy only be available to those who can afford it, and what would happen to those who need it but simply can’t afford it?

4. Cause society to be less accepting of people of different backgrounds or are ‘different’ from the ‘normal’ people and also end diversity.

5. The enhancement of human traits that want to be changed ex. Height, intelligence, athleticism.

6. The alignment of the use of gene therapy and the beliefs in different religions.

Gene therapy is a very controversial topic which is very relevant to this day, specifically about designer babies. This is the case where the embryo within a womb is genetically modified through the changing of genes. The main issue in this is that this would lead to the birth of a child with special traits and features, differing these people from others who didn't go through this treatment. This could cause a whole class of biologically ‘better’ people which could cause a division between normal people and the designer people, eventually causing people to be discriminated against or seen as less of a person than others. Also, the babies who are genetically modified cannot provide their consent to the treatment.
